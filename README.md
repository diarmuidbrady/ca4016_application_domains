# CA4016 Personal Data Analysis
As part of my final year module Application Domains 2, I am carrying out a data science project. This project involves gathering my own data and creating meaningful insights from it.

## Data Sources
I am gathering data from several sources including:

- SleepScore data
- Fitbit data
- CBT Thought Diary data

### SleepScore Data
This data is requested from the Data Science team at SleepScore Labs 30/09/2022 to 25/11/2022 and was sent through email.
It includes both sleep metrics (Total Sleep Time, Sleep Onset Latency etc.) and sleep related factors logged eg. Caffeine, Alcohol, Sleepiness, Mood and Stress.

### Fitbit Data
This data is exported from Fitbit from 30/09/2022 to 25/11/2022 and saved locally.
It includes both activity (Steps, Heart rate, Activity Minutes etc.) and Sleep tracking data (Total Sleep Time, Wakefulness After Sleep Onset etc.)

### CBT Thought Diary Data
This is exported in bulk as text file from the phone app and saved to iCloud storage.

None of the data is present on Github for data privacy.

## Directories
There are number of directories, each with a specific purpose.

### Deliverables
Contains the LaTex report documenting the project.

### Environments
This includes a yml environment file and is used to set up the environment with all relevant libraries and packages.

### Notebooks
All the notebooks used for data importing, cleaning, processing, engineering, analysing, modelling, visualising and all other steps in the process stored here.

### Specification
Contains the specification for the project assigned by our lecturer Dr. Cathal Gurrin.
