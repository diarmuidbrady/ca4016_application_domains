Sleep regularity predicts many health-related outcomes. Currently, however, there is no systematic approach to measuring sleep regularity. Traditionally, metrics have assessed deviations in sleep patterns from an individual’s average; these traditional metrics include intra-individual standard deviation (StDev), interdaily stability (IS), and social jet lag (SJL). Two metrics were recently proposed that instead measure variability between consecutive days: composite phase deviation (CPD) and sleep regularity index (SRI). Using large-scale simulations, we investigated the theoretical properties of these five metrics.

Methods
Multiple sleep–wake patterns were systematically simulated, including variability in daily sleep timing and/or duration. Average estimates and 95\% confidence intervals were calculated for six scenarios that affect the measurement of sleep regularity: “scrambling” the order of days; daily vs. weekly variation; naps; awakenings; “all-nighters”; and length of study.

Results
SJL measured weekly but not daily changes. Scrambling did not affect StDev or IS, but did affect CPD and SRI; these metrics, therefore, measure sleep regularity on multi-day and day-to-day timescales, respectively. StDev and CPD did not capture sleep fragmentation. IS and SRI behaved similarly in response to naps and awakenings but differed markedly for all-nighters. StDev and IS required over a week of sleep–wake data for unbiased estimates, whereas CPD and SRI required larger sample sizes to detect group differences.

Conclusions
Deciding which sleep regularity metric is most appropriate for a given study depends on a combination of the type of data gathered, the study length and sample size, and which aspects of sleep regularity are most pertinent to the research question.},

	abstract = {Social jetlag (SJL), the difference in sleep timing between work and free days is a consequence of the discrepancy between the individual’s circadian rhythm and the social clock. SJL is considered a chronic stress factor and has been linked to various health problems. In this field study, we examined for the first time the association between SJL and cardiac regulation during sleep. 33 healthy young men aged 20–26 years participated in the study. The median SJL was used as a cut-off value to assign the participants into two groups with either lower or higher SJL. As a marker of autonomic control we analyzed heart rate variability (HRV) and addressed intra-individual differences between workdays and free days. In subjects with higher SJL, pNN50, an indicator of vagal activity was lower in the first 3 h of sleep on workday as compared to free day (day × sleep block × group, p = 0.015), indicating a more adaptable regulation on free days, when subjects slept according to their own preference. However, in subjects with lower SJL, no HRV differences were found between the two nights. SJL showed correlation with the free day-workday differences of both pNN50 and another vagal index, RMSSD in the first 2 h of sleep (p = 0.023 and 0.047, respectively). In subjects with higher SJL, a different HF power on workdays and free days (p = 0.031) also indicated that a shift in sleep timing is accompanied by an altered parasympathetic activity in the first few hours of sleep. Furthermore, subjective sleep quality on workdays was negatively associated with SJL (p = 0.02), and subjects with higher SJL reported worse sleep quality on workday than on free day (p = 0.027). Taken together, our data call attention on the potential effect of SJL on sleep quality and vagal activity during sleep.},

TAP acrophase was able to assess eveningness. As compared to more morning-types, more evening-types displayed lower amplitude in temperature rhythms, increased physical activity in the evening, delayed sleep and midpoint of intake and had\&nbsp;more frequent social jet lag (P \&lt; 0.05). More evening-types had higher light intensity at 2\&nbsp;h before sleep and lower melatonin values (01:00\&nbsp;h). Eveningness associated with higher BMI and metabolic risk (higher values of insulin, glucose, triglycerides and cholesterol). Evening-types presented better grades in art.

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: Consumer sleep-tracking devices are widely used and becoming more technologically advanced, creating strong interest from researchers and clinicians for their possible use as alternatives to standard actigraphy. We, therefore, tested the performance of many of the latest consumer sleep-tracking devices, alongside actigraphy, versus the gold-standard sleep assessment technique, polysomnography (PSG).
METHODS: In total, 34 healthy young adults (22 women; 28.1 ± 3.9 years, mean ± SD) were tested on three consecutive nights (including a disrupted sleep condition) in a sleep laboratory with PSG, along with actigraphy (Philips Respironics Actiwatch 2) and a subset of consumer sleep-tracking devices. Altogether, four wearable (Fatigue Science Readiband, Fitbit Alta HR, Garmin Fenix 5S, Garmin Vivosmart 3) and three nonwearable (EarlySense Live, ResMed S+, SleepScore Max) devices were tested. Sleep/wake summary and epoch-by-epoch agreement measures were compared with PSG.
RESULTS: Most devices (Fatigue Science Readiband, Fitbit Alta HR, EarlySense Live, ResMed S+, SleepScore Max) performed as well as or better than actigraphy on sleep/wake performance measures, while the Garmin devices performed worse. Overall, epoch-by-epoch sensitivity was high (all ≥0.93), specificity was low-to-medium (0.18-0.54), sleep stage comparisons were mixed, and devices tended to perform worse on nights with poorer/disrupted sleep.
CONCLUSIONS: Consumer sleep-tracking devices exhibited high performance in detecting sleep, and most performed equivalent to (or better than) actigraphy in detecting wake. Device sleep stage assessments were inconsistent. Findings indicate that many newer sleep-tracking devices demonstrate promising performance for tracking sleep and wake. Devices should be tested in different populations and settings to further examine their wider validity and utility.},

We compare the sleep data on each of the tracking nights between all four devices, and showcase that while each device has been validated with the polysomnography (PSG) gold standard, the devices show highly varying results in everyday use. Differences between devices for measuring sleep duration or sleep stages on a single night can be up to an average of 1 h 36 min. Study participants provided their expectations and experiences with the devices, and provided qualitative insights into their usage throughout the daily questionnaires. The participants assessed each device according to ease of use, functionality and reliability, and comfortability and effect on sleep disturbances.

	abstract = {Background
Wearable sleep monitors are of high interest to consumers and researchers because of their ability to provide estimation of sleep patterns in free-living conditions in a cost-efficient way.

Objective
We conducted a systematic review of publications reporting on the performance of wristband Fitbit models in assessing sleep parameters and stages.

Methods
In adherence with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, we comprehensively searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane, Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases using the keyword Fitbit to identify relevant publications meeting predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Results
The search yielded 3085 candidate articles. After eliminating duplicates and in compliance with inclusion and exclusion criteria, 22 articles qualified for systematic review, with 8 providing quantitative data for meta-analysis. In reference to polysomnography (PSG), nonsleep-staging Fitbit models tended to overestimate total sleep time (TST; range from approximately 7 to 67 mins; effect size=-0.51, P{\textless}.001; heterogenicity: I2=8.8\%, P=.36) and sleep efficiency (SE; range from approximately 2\% to 15\%; effect size=-0.74, P{\textless}.001; heterogenicity: I2=24.0\%, P=.25), and underestimate wake after sleep onset (WASO; range from approximately 6 to 44 mins; effect size=0.60, P{\textless}.001; heterogenicity: I2=0\%, P=.92) and there was no significant difference in sleep onset latency (SOL; P=.37; heterogenicity: I2=0\%, P=.92). In reference to PSG, nonsleep-staging Fitbit models correctly identified sleep epochs with accuracy values between 0.81 and 0.91, sensitivity values between 0.87 and 0.99, and specificity values between 0.10 and 0.52. Recent-generation Fitbit models that collectively utilize heart rate variability and body movement to assess sleep stages performed better than early-generation nonsleep-staging ones that utilize only body movement. Sleep-staging Fitbit models, in comparison to PSG, showed no significant difference in measured values of WASO (P=.25; heterogenicity: I2=0\%, P=.92), TST (P=.29; heterogenicity: I2=0\%, P=.98), and SE (P=.19) but they underestimated SOL (P=.03; heterogenicity: I2=0\%, P=.66). Sleep-staging Fitbit models showed higher sensitivity (0.95-0.96) and specificity (0.58-0.69) values in detecting sleep epochs than nonsleep-staging models and those reported in the literature for regular wrist actigraphy.

Conclusions
Sleep-staging Fitbit models showed promising performance, especially in differentiating wake from sleep. However, although these models are a convenient and economical means for consumers to obtain gross estimates of sleep parameters and time spent in sleep stages, they are of limited specificity and are not a substitute for PSG.},

Sleep monitoring can be achieved by placing a smartphone onto the bedside table and starting a custom app. The app employs sophisticated and novel proprietary algorithms to identify sleep stages: Wake (W), Light Sleep (N1, N2 sleep), Deep Sleep (N3 sleep), Rapid Eye Movement (REM) Sleep or Absence.The sleep staging performance of the app were assessed by testing it against expert manually scored polysomnography (PSG) of 38 subjects gathered in a sleep laboratory. As a secondary assessment, on the same dataset, the performance of the app is compared to that of a reference non-contact device, the S+ by ResMed.Performance across different sleep stage detections was balanced, exceeding the agreement typically reported for actigraphy based devices [1], [2] thanks to a significantly higher sensitivity for all sleep stages. Furthermore, the performance of the app was found to be comparable to the S+ by ResMed product [3], [4].The combination of unobtrusive non-contact sensing and accurate sleep quality assessment, coupled with removal of the requirement to purchase a custom device to enable monitoring of sleep, enables consumers to measure their sleep in the home environment in a zero-cost and accessible manner, while providing sleep staging information not otherwise available with actigraphy based devices.},

We consider the potential for digital data ? and their unanticipated affects ? to linger within habitual practices even after the device is abandoned. We draw on the philosophies of Felix Ravaisson and Gilles Deleuze to understand habit as a capacity for change, rather than a performance of sameness. We trace how self-tracking prompts new embodiments that continue to unfold even after people disengage. In decentring the device as our object of attention, we trouble the logic that self-tracking simply ?stops? in its absence.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective was to conduct a scientifically rigorous update to the National Sleep Foundation's sleep duration recommendations.
METHODS: The National Sleep Foundation convened an 18-member multidisciplinary expert panel, representing 12 stakeholder organizations, to evaluate scientific literature concerning sleep duration recommendations. We determined expert recommendations for sufficient sleep durations across the lifespan using the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method.
RESULTS: The panel agreed that, for healthy individuals with normal sleep, the appropriate sleep duration for newborns is between 14 and 17 hours, infants between 12 and 15 hours, toddlers between 11 and 14 hours, preschoolers between 10 and 13 hours, and school-aged children between 9 and 11 hours. For teenagers, 8 to 10 hours was considered appropriate, 7 to 9 hours for young adults and adults, and 7 to 8 hours of sleep for older adults.
CONCLUSIONS: Sufficient sleep duration requirements vary across the lifespan and from person to person. The recommendations reported here represent guidelines for healthy individuals and those not suffering from a sleep disorder. Sleep durations outside the recommended range may be appropriate, but deviating far from the normal range is rare. Individuals who habitually sleep outside the normal range may be exhibiting signs or symptoms of serious health problems or, if done volitionally, may be compromising their health and well-being.},

	abstract = {The term social jetlag is used to describe the discrepancy between biological time, determined by our internal body clock, and social times, mainly dictated by social obligations such as school or work. In industrialized countries, two-thirds of the studying/working population experiences social jetlag, often for several years. Described for the first time in 2006, a considerable effort has been put into understanding the effects of social jetlag on human physiopathology, yet our understanding of this phenomenon is still very limited. Due to its high prevalence, social jetlag is becoming a primary concern for public health. This review summarizes current knowledge regarding social jetlag, social jetlag associated behavior (e.g., unhealthy eating patterns) and related risks for human health.},

	abstract = {Step-based recommendations may be appropriate for dementia-prevention guidelines. However, the association of step count and intensity with dementia incidence is unknown.To examine the dose-response association between daily step count and intensity and incidence of all-cause dementia among adults in the UK.UK Biobank prospective population-based cohort study (February 2013 to December 2015) with 6.9 years of follow-up (data analysis conducted May 2022). A total of 78 430 of 103 684 eligible adults aged 40 to 79 years with valid wrist accelerometer data were included. Registry-based dementia was ascertained through October 2021.Accelerometer-derived daily step count, incidental steps (less than 40 steps per minute), purposeful steps (40 steps per minute or more), and peak 30-minute cadence (ie, mean steps per minute recorded for the 30 highest, not necessarily consecutive, minutes in a day).Incident dementia (fatal and nonfatal), obtained through linkage with inpatient hospitalization or primary care records or recorded as the underlying or contributory cause of death in death registers. Spline Cox regressions were used to assess dose-response associations.The study monitored 78 430 adults (mean [SD] age, 61.1 [7.9] years; 35 040 [44.7\%] male and 43 390 [55.3\%] female; 881 [1.1\%] were Asian, 641 [0.8\%] were Black, 427 [0.5\%] were of mixed race, 75 852 [96.7\%] were White,  and 629 [0.8\%] were of another, unspecified race) over a median (IQR) follow-up of 6.9 (6.4-7.5) years, 866 of whom developed dementia (mean [SD] age, 68.3 [5.6] years; 480 [55.4\%] male and 386 [54.6\%] female; 5 [0.6\%] Asian, 6 [0.7\%] Black, 4 [0.4\%] mixed race, 821 [97.6\%] White, and 6 [0.7\%] other). Analyses revealed nonlinear associations between daily steps. The optimal dose (ie, exposure value at which the maximum risk reduction was observed) was 9826 steps (hazard ratio [HR], 0.49; 95\% CI, 0.39-0.62) and the minimal dose (ie, exposure value at which the risk reduction was 50\% of the observed maximum risk reduction) was 3826 steps (HR, 0.75; 95\% CI, 0.67-0.83). The incidental cadence optimal dose was 3677 steps (HR, 0.58; 95\% CI, 0.44-0.72); purposeful cadence optimal dose was 6315 steps (HR, 0.43; 95\% CI, 0.32-0.58); and peak 30-minute cadence optimal dose was 112 steps per minute (HR, 0.38; 95\% CI, 0.24-0.60).In this cohort study, a higher number of steps was associated with lower risk of all-cause dementia. The findings suggest that a dose of just under 10 000 steps per day may be optimally associated with a lower risk of dementia. Steps performed at higher intensity resulted in stronger associations.},

	abstract = {AIM: To investigate the effects of students' usual levels of alcohol consumption on aspects of mood and anxiety the following morning.
METHODS: Students were recruited who consumed their usual quantity of any type of alcoholic beverage in their chosen company and then completed assessments of the effects the following day. The timing of drinking was restricted to the period between 22:00 and 02:00 h the night before testing as these are the most popular hours for consuming alcohol in the population under investigation. The testing included an assessment of mood and anxiety; testing was also performed after an evening of abstinence (no hangover condition), following a counterbalanced repeated measure design, with time of testing and order of testing as 'between participant' factors. Forty-eight student social drinkers (33 women, 15 men) aged between 18 and 43 years were tested, with a 1 week interval between test sessions.
RESULTS: Males reported consuming on average 14.7 units and females 10.5 units the night before testing. On the morning after alcohol consumption, ratings of alertness and tranquility were lower than the ratings the morning following an evening of abstinence at both 11:00 and 13:00 h and the post intoxication physical symptoms, emotional symptoms and symptoms of fatigue persisted throughout the morning.
CONCLUSION: Heavy alcohol consumption lowers mood, disrupts sleep, increases anxiety and produces physical symptoms, emotional symptoms and symptoms of fatigue throughout the next morning.},

	abstract = {The association of irregular sleep schedules with circadian timing and academic performance has not been systematically examined. We studied 61 undergraduates for 30 days using sleep diaries, and quantified sleep regularity using a novel metric, the sleep regularity index (SRI). In the most and least regular quintiles, circadian phase and light exposure were assessed using salivary dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO) and wrist-worn photometry, respectively. DLMO occurred later (00:08 ± 1:54 vs. 21:32 ± 1:48; p {\textless} 0.003); the daily sleep propensity rhythm peaked later (06:33 ± 0:19 vs. 04:45 ± 0:11; p {\textless} 0.005); and light rhythms had lower amplitude (102 ± 19 lux vs. 179 ± 29 lux; p {\textless} 0.005) in Irregular compared to Regular sleepers. A mathematical model of the circadian pacemaker and its response to light was used to demonstrate that Irregular vs. Regular group differences in circadian timing were likely primarily due to their different patterns of light exposure. A positive correlation (r = 0.37; p {\textless} 0.004) between academic performance and SRI was observed. These findings show that irregular sleep and light exposure patterns in college students are associated with delayed circadian rhythms and lower academic performance. Moreover, the modeling results reveal that light-based interventions may be therapeutically effective in improving sleep regularity in this population.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Irregular sleep-wake schedules are commonplace in modern society. Recent studies have indicated the importance of sleep regularity, in addition to sleep duration. We studied in college students how weekly sleep regularity is predictive of daily self-reported happiness, healthiness and calmness, during one week and on the first day following that week.

Methods
204 college students (aged 18–25, 132 male) participated in a 30-day field study. Sleep timing and duration were monitored using both actigraphy and daily morning and evening Internet-based diaries. Self-reports of wellbeing (happiness, healthiness, and calmness) were collected via daily diaries, morning and evening, with non-numeric visual-analog scales. The sleep regularity index was computed weekly, as the likelihood of being awake or asleep across all time-points 24-hours apart. We used generalized estimating equations that controlled for weekly average sleep duration to examine how sleep regularity relates with self-reported wellbeing. We also examined how the three wellbeing measures change with sleep regularity transitions (e.g. regular to irregular, irregular to regular) both in participants who had {\textless}7 hours and {\textgreater}= 7 hours average sleep duration. Bonferroni corrections were made for all analyses.

Results
Higher sleep regularity was statistically significantly related to higher morning and evening happiness, healthiness and calmness (p {\textless} 0.01) during the week. On the first day following the week, these results hold (p{\textless}0.01) for all but morning healthiness. For the sleep regularity weekly transitions, in sleepers who averaged {\textless} 7 hours, the irregular-regular sleep transition showed a greater increase in morning happiness and calmness (p {\textless} 0.01), and evening calmness (p {\textless} 0.01) than the regular-regular sleep transition.

Conclusion
Regular sleep patterns were found to be associated with better wellbeing in college students. A transition from irregular to regular weekly sleep patterns was associated with improved happiness and calmness both during the week of regular sleep and on the day following it. This work underlines the necessity of considering sleep regularity, in addition to sleep duration, as an important factor for understanding self-reported wellbeing.
